<h1>Hello and Welcome!</h1>

<div class="">
<p>
continue searching for hidden messages,<br>
like reading the text <br>
in different ways, <br>
clicking on different letters, <br>
knowing if there is something hidden. <br>
<br />

<a href="index3.html">1</a>06548920857234 is a number i put in this text, randomly or not? <br>
<br />

to you, finding the pattern here might seem easy, <br>
or maybe you need some more hints. <br>
<br />

could the random sentence with numbers tell you anything? <br>
or does the linebreaking seem odd? Maybe you're <br>
not looking for the right things. <br>
to find hidden messages can be complex, or maybe not. the numbers <br>
in 05492093 could mean something <br>
now look away from the different numbers. Look <br>
up <br>
easy right?
